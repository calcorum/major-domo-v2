  - `!private` â†’ Shows migration message to `/voice-channel private`

### `cleanup_service.py`
- **Class**: `VoiceChannelCleanupService`
- **Description**: Manages automatic cleanup of bot-created voice channels
- **Features**:
  - Restart-resilient channel tracking using JSON persistence
  - Configurable cleanup intervals and empty thresholds
  - Background monitoring loop with error recovery
  - Startup verification to clean stale tracking entries

### `tracker.py`
- **Class**: `VoiceChannelTracker`
- **Description**: JSON-based persistent tracking of voice channels
- **Features**:
  - Channel creation and status tracking
  - Empty duration monitoring with datetime handling
  - Cleanup candidate identification
  - Automatic stale entry removal

### `__init__.py`
- **Function**: `setup_voice(bot)`
- **Description**: Package initialization with resilient cog loading
- **Integration**: Follows established bot architecture patterns

## Key Features

### Public Voice Channels (`/voice-channel public`)
- **Permissions**: Everyone can connect and speak
- **Naming**: Random codename generation (e.g., "Gameplay Phoenix", "Gameplay Thunder")
- **Requirements**: User must own a Major League team (3-character abbreviations like NYY, BOS)
- **Auto-cleanup**: Configurable threshold (default: empty for configured minutes)

### Private Voice Channels (`/voice-channel private`)
- **Permissions**:
  - Team members can connect and speak (using `team.lname` Discord roles)
  - Everyone else can connect but only listen
- **Naming**: Automatic "{Away} vs {Home}" format based on current week's schedule
- **Opponent Detection**: Uses current league week to find scheduled opponent
- **Requirements**:
  - User must own a Major League team (3-character abbreviations like NYY, BOS)
  - Team must have upcoming games in current week
- **Role Integration**: Finds Discord roles matching team full names (`team.lname`)

### Automatic Cleanup System
- **Monitoring Interval**: 1 minute (using `@tasks.loop` pattern)
- **Empty Threshold**: 5 minutes empty before deletion
- **Restart Resilience**: JSON file persistence survives bot restarts
- **Safe Startup**: Uses `@before_loop` to wait for bot readiness before starting
- **Startup Verification**: Validates tracked channels still exist and cleans stale entries on bot startup
- **Manual Deletion Handling**: Detects manually deleted channels and cleans up tracking
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Continues operation even if individual operations fail
- **Scorecard Cleanup**: Automatically unpublishes scorecards in all cleanup scenarios:
  - Normal cleanup (channel empty for 5+ minutes)
  - Manual deletion (user deletes channel)
  - Startup verification (stale entries on bot restart)
  - Wrong channel type (corrupted tracking data)

## Architecture

### Command Flow
1. **Major League Team Verification**: Check user owns a Major League team using `team_service`
2. **Channel Creation**: Create voice channel with appropriate permissions
3. **Tracking Registration**: Add channel to cleanup service tracking
4. **User Feedback**: Send success embed with channel details

### Team Validation Logic
The voice channel system validates that users own **Major League teams** specifically:

```python
async def _get_user_major_league_team(self, user_id: int, season: Optional[int] = None):
    """Get the user's Major League team for schedule/game purposes."""
    teams = await team_service.get_teams_by_owner(user_id, season)

    # Filter to only Major League teams (3-character abbreviations)
    major_league_teams = [team for team in teams if team.roster_type() == RosterType.MAJOR_LEAGUE]

    return major_league_teams[0] if major_league_teams else None
```

**Team Types:**
- **Major League**: 3-character abbreviations (e.g., NYY, BOS, LAD) - **Required for voice channels**
- **Minor League**: 4+ characters ending in "MIL" (e.g., NYYMIL, BOSMIL) - **Not eligible**
- **Injured List**: Ending in "IL" (e.g., NYYIL, BOSIL) - **Not eligible**

**Rationale:** Only Major League teams participate in weekly scheduled games, so voice channel creation is restricted to active Major League team owners.

### Permission System
```python
# Public channels - everyone can speak
overwrites = {
    guild.default_role: discord.PermissionOverwrite(speak=True, connect=True)
}

# Private channels - team roles only can speak
overwrites = {
    guild.default_role: discord.PermissionOverwrite(speak=False, connect=True),
    user_team_role: discord.PermissionOverwrite(speak=True, connect=True),
    opponent_team_role: discord.PermissionOverwrite(speak=True, connect=True)
}
```

### Cleanup Service Integration
```python
# Bot initialization (bot.py)
from commands.voice.cleanup_service import setup_voice_cleanup
self.voice_cleanup_service = setup_voice_cleanup(self)

# The service uses @tasks.loop pattern with @before_loop
# It automatically waits for bot readiness before starting

# Channel tracking
if hasattr(self.bot, 'voice_cleanup_service'):
    cleanup_service = self.bot.voice_cleanup_service
    cleanup_service.tracker.add_channel(channel, channel_type, interaction.user.id)
```

**Task Lifecycle**:
- **Initialization**: `VoiceChannelCleanupService(bot)` creates instance
- **Startup Wait**: `@before_loop` ensures bot is ready before first cycle
- **Verification**: First cycle runs `verify_tracked_channels()` to clean stale entries
- **Monitoring**: Runs every 1 minute checking all tracked channels
- **Shutdown**: `cog_unload()` cancels the cleanup loop gracefully

### Scorecard Cleanup Integration
The cleanup service automatically unpublishes any scorecard associated with a voice channel when that channel is removed from tracking. This prevents the live scorebug tracker from continuing to update scores for games that no longer have active voice channels.

**Cleanup Scenarios**:

1. **Normal Cleanup** (channel empty for 5+ minutes):
   - Cleanup service deletes the voice channel
   - Unpublishes associated scorecard
   - Logs: `"ðŸ“‹ Unpublished scorecard from text channel [id] (voice channel cleanup)"`

2. **Manual Deletion** (user deletes channel):
   - Next cleanup cycle detects missing channel
   - Removes from tracking and unpublishes scorecard
   - Logs: `"ðŸ“‹ Unpublished scorecard from text channel [id] (manually deleted voice channel)"`

3. **Startup Verification** (stale entries on bot restart):
   - Bot startup detects channels that no longer exist
   - Cleans up tracking and unpublishes scorecards
   - Logs: `"ðŸ“‹ Unpublished scorecard from text channel [id] (stale voice channel)"`

4. **Wrong Channel Type** (corrupted tracking data):
   - Tracked channel exists but is not a voice channel
   - Removes from tracking and unpublishes scorecard
   - Logs: `"ðŸ“‹ Unpublished scorecard from text channel [id] (wrong channel type)"`

**Integration Points**:
- `cleanup_service.py` imports `ScorecardTracker` from `commands.gameplay.scorecard_tracker`
- All cleanup paths check for `text_channel_id` and unpublish if found
- Recovery time: Maximum 1 minute delay for manual deletions

**Example Logging**:
```
âœ… Cleaned up empty voice channel: Gameplay Phoenix (ID: 123456789)
ðŸ“‹ Unpublished scorecard from text channel 987654321 (voice channel cleanup)
```

### JSON Data Structure
```json
{
  "voice_channels": {
    "123456789": {
      "channel_id": "123456789",
      "guild_id": "987654321",
      "name": "Gameplay Phoenix",
      "type": "public",
      "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00",
      "last_checked": "2025-01-15T10:35:00",
      "empty_since": "2025-01-15T10:32:00",
      "creator_id": "111222333",
      "text_channel_id": "555666777"
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: The `text_channel_id` field links the voice channel to its associated text channel, enabling automatic scorecard cleanup when the voice channel is deleted.

## Configuration

### Cleanup Service Settings
- **Monitoring Loop**: `@tasks.loop(minutes=1)` - runs every 1 minute
- **`empty_threshold`**: 5 minutes empty before deletion
- **`data_file`**: JSON persistence file path (default: "data/voice_channels.json")
- **Task Pattern**: Uses discord.py `@tasks.loop` with `@before_loop` for safe startup

### Channel Categories
- Channels are created in the "Voice Channels" category if it exists
- Falls back to no category if "Voice Channels" category not found

### Random Codenames
```python
CODENAMES = [
    "Phoenix", "Thunder", "Lightning", "Storm", "Blaze", "Frost", "Shadow", "Nova",
    "Viper", "Falcon", "Wolf", "Eagle", "Tiger", "Shark", "Bear", "Dragon",
    "Alpha", "Beta", "Gamma", "Delta", "Echo", "Foxtrot", "Golf", "Hotel",
    "Crimson", "Azure", "Emerald", "Golden", "Silver", "Bronze", "Platinum", "Diamond"
]
```

## Error Handling

### Common Scenarios
- **No Team Found**: User-friendly message directing to contact league administrator
- **No Upcoming Games**: Informative message about being between series
- **Missing Discord Roles**: Warning in embed about teams without speaking permissions
- **Permission Errors**: Clear message to contact server administrator
- **League Info Unavailable**: Graceful fallback with retry suggestion

### Service Dependencies
- **Graceful Degradation**: Voice channels work without cleanup service
- **API Failures**: Comprehensive error handling for external service calls
- **Discord Errors**: Specific handling for Forbidden, NotFound, etc.

## Testing Coverage

### Test Files
- **`tests/test_commands_voice.py`**: Comprehensive test suite covering:
  - VoiceChannelTracker JSON persistence and datetime handling

## Integration Points

### Bot Integration
- **Package Loading**: Integrated into `bot.py` command package loading sequence
- **Background Tasks**: Cleanup service started in `_setup_background_tasks()`
- **Shutdown Handling**: Cleanup service stopped in `bot.close()`

### Service Layer
- **Team Service**: User team verification and ownership lookup
- **League Service**: Current season/week information retrieval
- **Schedule Service**: Team schedule and opponent detection

### Discord Integration
- **Application Commands**: Modern slash command interface with command groups

- **Error Handling**: Integration with global application command error handler

## Usage Examples

### Creating Public Channel
```
/voice-channel public
```
**Result**: Creates "Gameplay [Codename]" with public speaking permissions

### Creating Private Channel
```
/voice-channel private
```
**Result**: Creates "[Away] vs [Home]" with team-only speaking permissions

### Migration from Old Commands
```
!vc
```
**Result**: Shows deprecation message suggesting `/voice-channel public`

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
- **Channel Limits**: Per-user or per-team channel creation limits
- **Custom Names**: Allow users to specify custom channel names
- **Extended Permissions**: More granular permission control options
- **Channel Templates**: Predefined setups for different game types
- **Integration Webhooks**: Notifications when channels are created/deleted
