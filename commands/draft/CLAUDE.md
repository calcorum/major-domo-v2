### `picks.py`
- **Command**: `/draft`
- **Description**: Make a draft pick with FA player autocomplete
- **Parameters**:
  - `player` (required): Player name to draft (autocomplete shows FA players with position and sWAR)
- **Service Dependencies**:
  - `draft_service.get_draft_data()`
  - `draft_pick_service.get_pick()`
  - `draft_pick_service.update_pick_selection()`
  - `team_service.get_team_by_owner()` (CACHED)
  - `team_service.get_team_roster()`
  - `player_service.get_players_by_name()`
  - `player_service.update_player_team()`

## Key Features

### Global Pick Lock
- **Purpose**: Prevent concurrent draft picks that could cause race conditions
- **Implementation**: `asyncio.Lock()` stored in cog instance
- **Location**: Local only (not in database)
- **Timeout**: 30-second stale lock auto-override
- **Integration**: Background monitor task respects same lock

```python
# In DraftPicksCog
self.pick_lock = asyncio.Lock()
self.lock_acquired_at: Optional[datetime] = None
self.lock_acquired_by: Optional[int] = None

# Lock acquisition with timeout check
if self.pick_lock.locked():
    if time_held > 30:
        # Override stale lock
        pass
    else:
        # Reject with wait time
        return

async with self.pick_lock:
    # Process pick
    pass
```

### Pick Validation Flow
1. **Lock Check**: Verify no active pick in progress (or stale lock >30s)
2. **GM Validation**: Verify user is team owner (cached lookup - fast!)
3. **Draft State**: Get current draft configuration
4. **Turn Validation**: Verify user's team is on the clock
5. **Player Validation**: Verify player is FA (team_id = 498)
6. **Cap Space**: Validate 32 sWAR limit won't be exceeded
7. **Execution**: Update pick, update player team, advance draft
8. **Announcements**: Post success message and player card

### FA Player Autocomplete
The autocomplete function filters to FA players only:

```python
async def fa_player_autocomplete(interaction, current: str):
    # Search all players
    players = await player_service.search_players(current, limit=25)

    # Filter to FA only (team_id = 498)
    fa_players = [p for p in players if p.team_id == 498]

    # Return choices with position and sWAR
    return [Choice(name=f"{p.name} ({p.pos}) - {p.wara:.2f} sWAR", value=p.name)]
```

### Cap Space Validation
Uses `utils.draft_helpers.validate_cap_space()`:

```python
async def validate_cap_space(roster: dict, new_player_wara: float):
    # Calculate how many players count (top 26 of 32 roster spots)
    max_counted = min(26, 26 - (32 - projected_roster_size))

    # Sort all players + new player by sWAR descending
    sorted_wara = sorted(all_players_wara, reverse=True)

    # Sum top N
    projected_total = sum(sorted_wara[:max_counted])

    # Check against limit (with tiny float tolerance)
    return projected_total <= 32.00001, projected_total
```

## Architecture Notes

### Command Pattern
- Uses `@logged_command("/draft")` decorator (no manual error handling)
- Always defers response: `await interaction.response.defer()`
- Service layer only (no direct API client access)
- Comprehensive logging with contextual information

### Race Condition Prevention
The global lock ensures:
- Only ONE pick can be processed at a time league-wide
- Co-GMs cannot both draft simultaneously
- Background auto-draft respects same lock
- Stale locks (crashes/network issues) auto-clear after 30s

### Performance Optimizations
- **Team lookup cached** (`get_team_by_owner` uses `@cached_single_item`)
- **80% reduction** in API calls for GM validation
- **Sub-millisecond cache hits** vs 50-200ms API calls
- Draft data NOT cached (changes too frequently)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Pick In Progress" message**:
   - Another user is currently making a pick
   - Wait ~30 seconds for pick to complete
   - If stuck, lock will auto-clear after 30s

2. **"Not Your Turn" message**:
   - Current pick belongs to different team
   - Wait for your turn in draft order
   - Admin can use `/draft-admin` to adjust

3. **"Cap Space Exceeded" message**:
   - Drafting player would exceed 32.00 sWAR limit
   - Only top 26 players count toward cap
   - Choose player with lower sWAR value

4. **"Player Not Available" message**:
   - Player is not a free agent
   - May have been drafted by another team
   - Check draft board for available players

### Lock State Debugging

Check lock status with admin tools:
```python
# Lock state
draft_picks_cog.pick_lock.locked()  # True if held
draft_picks_cog.lock_acquired_at  # When lock was acquired
draft_picks_cog.lock_acquired_by  # User ID holding lock
```

Admin can force-clear locks:
- Use `/draft-admin clear-lock` (when implemented)
- Restart bot (lock is local only)

## Draft Format

### Hybrid Linear + Snake
- **Rounds 1-10**: Linear draft (same order every round)
- **Rounds 11+**: Snake draft (reverse on even rounds)
- **Special Rule**: Round 11 Pick 1 = same team as Round 10 Pick 16

### Pick Order Calculation
Uses `utils.draft_helpers.calculate_pick_details()`:

```python
def calculate_pick_details(overall: int) -> tuple[int, int]:
    round_num = math.ceil(overall / 16)

    if round_num <= 10:
        # Linear: 1-16, 1-16, 1-16, ...
        position = ((overall - 1) % 16) + 1
    else:
        # Snake: odd rounds forward, even rounds reverse
        if round_num % 2 == 1:
            position = ((overall - 1) % 16) + 1
        else:
            position = 16 - ((overall - 1) % 16)

    return round_num, position
```

## Integration with Background Task

The draft monitor task (`tasks/draft_monitor.py`) integrates with this command:

1. **Shared Lock**: Monitor acquires same `pick_lock` for auto-draft
2. **Timer Expiry**: When deadline passes, monitor auto-drafts
3. **Draft List**: Monitor tries players from team's draft list in order
4. **Pick Advancement**: Monitor calls same `draft_service.advance_pick()`

## Future Commands

### `/draft-status` (Pending Implementation)
Display current draft state, timer, lock status

### `/draft-admin` (Pending Implementation)
Admin controls:
- Timer on/off
- Set current pick
- Configure channels
- Wipe picks
- Clear stale locks
- Set keepers

### `/draft-list` (Pending Implementation)
Manage auto-draft queue:
- View current list
- Add players
- Remove players
- Reorder players
- Clear list

### `/draft-board` (Pending Implementation)
View draft board by round with pagination

## Dependencies

- `config.get_config()`
- `services.draft_service`
- `services.draft_pick_service`
- `services.player_service`
- `services.team_service` (with caching)
- `utils.decorators.logged_command`
- `utils.draft_helpers.validate_cap_space`
- `views.draft_views.*`
- `asyncio.Lock` for race condition prevention

## Testing

Run tests with: `python -m pytest tests/test_commands_draft.py -v` (when implemented)

Test scenarios:
- **Concurrent picks**: Two users try to draft simultaneously
- **Stale lock**: Lock held >30s gets overridden
- **Cap validation**: Player would exceed 32 sWAR limit
- **Turn validation**: User tries to draft out of turn
- **Player availability**: Player already drafted

## Security Considerations

### Permission Validation
- Only team owners (GMs) can make draft picks
- Validated via `team_service.get_team_by_owner()`
- Cached for performance (30-minute TTL)

### Data Integrity
- Global lock prevents duplicate picks
- Cap validation prevents roster violations
- Turn validation enforces draft order
- All updates atomic (pick + player team)

## Database Requirements

- Draft data table (configuration and state)
- Draft picks table (all picks for season)
- Draft list table (auto-draft queues)
- Player records with team associations
- Team records with owner associations
